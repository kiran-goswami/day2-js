    <h1>
        Data types:-
    </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Data types in a programming language is a classification 
            that  specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of
            mathematical , relayional or logical operaations can be applied to 
            it without causing error. </li>
        <li> a string for example, is a data type that is used to classify text and integer 
             is a type used to classify whole numbers.<br>
             string can take any value number, decimal numbers but in double quotes or single quotes  </li>
        <li>boolean data type has only two values either true or false</li>  
        <li>includes integers and decimal values or we can say float values</li>  
    </ul>
    <h2>Vaariables</h2>
    <p>variables are used to store values which is of any type string boolean numbers </p>
    <h2>rules for assigning names to variables</h2>
    <ol type="a">
        <li>try to make the variables name declaration</li>
        <li>it uses camel case</li>
        <li>keywords variable name=value
            value can be of any type boolean,string, number.
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h3>keywords:-</h3>
    <p>keywords are predefined , reserved words used in programming language that have 
       speacial meaning to compiler or interpreter.
    </p>
    <p>we are learning three types of keywords.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>let</li>
        <li>const</li>
        <li>var</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>let - These keywords are used to assign variables with values<br>
            1 . They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in anaother lines.<br>
            2 . They can be also declared and initialized in the same line<br>
            3 . They cannot be redeclared.....But can be reinitialized....<br>
            4 . ******We cannot have Two Variables with same name in Let*******</li>
            5 . We cant have variable with same name.
        <li>const -These keywords are used to assign variables with values<br> 
            1 . They can be declared in a line and then initializd with a value in another line is not possible<br>
            2 . They can be also declared and initialized in the same line<br>
            3 . They cant be redeclared.<br>
            4 . They cant be reinitialized also.<br>
            5 . We cant have variable with same name.
        </li>
        <li>var - These keywords are used to assign variables with values<br>
            1 . They can be declared in a line and then initialized with a value in another lines.<br>
            2. They can be also declared and initialized in the same line<br>
            3. They can be redeclared.....and also can be reinitialized....<br>
            4. ******We can have Two or more Variables with same name in Var*******</li>
            5 . We can have variable with same name.
    </ul>
